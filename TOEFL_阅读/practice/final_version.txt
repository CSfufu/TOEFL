I will choose to travel to historical sites which are must-goes for any tourists travelling to a new city for the first time, since they inform tourists 
of the most glorious culture and history about a city.My own experience can be a good case in point.During my first trip to Chendgdu which is a historic city,embracing a trenmendous culture,so I choose to travel to historical sites such as DUFU Thatched Cottage, Wuhou Shrine.I got totally absorbed in antiques dating back to thousand years ago,through which I savor the charm of the life in Chengdu and got the meaning of just enjoying the life in Chengdu.Moreover, it's because of that traveling to historical sites experiences that got me amazed at that city.Overall I strongly recommend that.
